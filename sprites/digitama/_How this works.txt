	Someone requested Digitama sprites, so I uploaded my collection here. My personal system is a little weird though: I assign a unique Digitama design and specific Baby I+II forms to each Child-Level Digimon. Some of them are colored versions of official sprites, a lot of them are heavily edited by me. Like everything else, it's very much a work in progress.

Enjoy! -Tortoiseshel
